# Miscellaneous Problem Solving

Questions provided are not from HackerRank. This section will mostly contain subqueries.

There are 3 types of subqueries:

 - **Scalar subquery** - return only 1 row and 1 column.
 - **Multiple row subquery** - returns multiple rows and mutiple columns or multiple rows and 1 column.
 - **Correlated subquery** - returns subquery related to outer query
 
**Note:** Correlated subquery is usually avoided due to its large processing. But for some problems, you have to use it.

```sql
  SELECT "emp_name"
  FROM "Employee" as e1
  WHERE "salary" > (SELECT AVG("salary")
                    FROM "Employee" AS e2
                    WHERE e2."dept_name" = e1."dept_name")
  GROUP BY e1."emp_name";
```

For the above query, the outer query will output a table and then the subquery will output a table matching with every row from a table came from outer query

So, if there is 1 million record, then 1 million records will be processed and then another 1 million records of same data will be matched with every row of 1st million records and that will make a processing of 1,000,000 x 1,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 records.

There are 4 clauses in SQL where we can use a subquery

 - SELECT
 - FROM
 - WHERE
 - HAVING

**Note:** 
 - It is advised not to use subquery in select clause because for every record the SEELCT clause will process, the whole query inside the SELECT clause will also process making the processing very huge. As a solution, you can use JOIN statement.

```sql
  SELECT *, (CASE
            WHEN "salary" > (SELECT AVG("salary") FROM "Employee") THEN 'You are rich'
            ELSE 'You are poor'
           END) as "remarks"
  FROM "Employee";
```

- There should be only scalar subquery in SELECT clause.

**WITH** Clause

When you are using same subquery multiple times, use WITH clause.
Basically, if you are creating a temp table for avg or sum, better to put it in WITH clause.

```sql
  WITH sales AS (SELECT "store_name", SUM("price") AS "total_sales"
                 FROM "Sales"
                 GROUP BY "store_name")
  SELECT *
  FROM sales;
```
